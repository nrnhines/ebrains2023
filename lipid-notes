Slide 1
    Physical -> Model involves abstraction. Capture relevance.

    Model -> representation  "Completely" faithful to conceptual model
       Ideal but hard to attain because of computer "accidents". Discretization.
       Don't want the representation to obscure the conceptuial model

Slide 2
    If apply a current across a lipid bilayer, what is the voltage
      across the bilayer?

    Model: bilayer is a capacitor.
        Catastrophically wrong model if the current is too large.
        Subtly wrong? How close is a lipid-bilayer to an "ideal" capacitor?

    Representation:
       That is the capacitor. Not shown is how to apply the current stimulus
       or how to see the stimulus and result of a run.

    Question. What is the voltage trajectory going to look like?
       Reward: Satisfaction if you guess (know) correctly.
               Surprise if you don't.
    
Slide 3
    If you are surprised: Do you need to change your intuition or do you
      need to find the program bug.
      A good strategy: Ask someone for an explanation.
